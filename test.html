        <h3>Nucleotides: 'conditionally essential' nutrients</h3>
        <p class="my-4">
            Since nucleotides can be synthesized de novo and recycled through salvage pathways, they are considered as
            semi-essential nutrients.

            However, rapidly growing tissues or proliferating immune cells during infection have higher requirements for
            nucleotides that cannot be met only through de novo synthesis. In these cases, nucleotides become
            "essential" nutrients that can be provided with aliments and assimilated through shorter salvage pathways (2
            steps) compared to de novo synthesis (9 steps for purines). Because of the fundamental importance of
            nucleotides for growth, development and immune health nucleotides are now widely recognized as
            “conditionally essential” nutrients.

                    Human breast milk contains significantly higher amounts of nucleotides compared to bovine milk or
                    cow milk protein-based infant formula. After being identified as one of the components of human milk
                    enhancing immune function, nucleotides (Nucleotide Monosphosphates) have been added to infant
                    formulas and have beneficial effects on early infant growth, small intestinal growth and
                    development, intestinal microflora, and immune function.

                    Fish meal is a natural source of nucleotides IMP, inosines and hypoxanthine issued from post-mortem
                    breakdown of ATP fish flesh.The content of IMP, nucleotide-precursor of adenine and guanine
                    nucleotides and feed stimulant, depends on the quality of raw material and the content of muscle
                    tissues used for fishmeal preparation. Since fishmeal is a limited natural resource, considerable
                    efforts are done toward its replacement by alternative products. Yeast are naturally rich in RNA
                    that are rapidly degraded to nucleotides and yeast extract are used as nucleotide supplement.
                    However, nucleotide content of yeast extracts is different from that of fishmeal. Yeast extract
                    contains much less of purine nucleotides required for ATP synthesis and more of pyrimidine
                    nucleotides. NOVOCIB offers analytical service for quantification of purine and pyrimidine bases,
                    nucleosides and nucleotides in fish meal.

                    Baker yeasts are rapidly proliferating cells naturally rich in tRNA. Baker yeast has been known as
                    an excellent source of both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides for decades. Prior to RNA hydrolysis
                    to NMP, yeast phosphatases must be inactivated or separated from RNA. Palatability of yeast extracts
                    can be further improved by enzymatic conversion of AMP to IMP.

                5'-nucleotides IMP and GMP (also known as Inosinate and Guanylate) are strong flavour enhancers
                (E626-E633) involved in "umami" taste and meat taste. Since yeasts are rich in ribonucleic acid (RNA), a
                natural source of 5' nucleotides (GMP, AMP, CMP and UMP), yeast extracts enriched in 5' nucleotides IMP
                and GMP are currently used as taste enhancers.
