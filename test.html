    Fish meal is a natural source of nucleotides IMP, inosines and hypoxanthine issued from post-mortem breakdown of ATP
    fish flesh.The content of IMP, nucleotide-precursor of adenine and guanine nucleotides and feed stimulant, depends
    on the quality of raw material and the content of muscle tissues used for fishmeal preparation. Since fishmeal is a
    limited natural resource, considerable efforts are done toward its replacement by alternative products. Yeast are
    naturally rich in RNA that are rapidly degraded to nucleotides and yeast extract are used as nucleotide supplement.
    However, nucleotide content of yeast extracts is different from that of fishmeal. Yeast extract contains much less
    of purine nucleotides required for ATP synthesis and more of pyrimidine nucleotides. NOVOCIB offers analytical
    service for quantification of purine and pyrimidine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides in fish meal.
