                    Yeasts are naturally rich in RNA and are known as an excellent source of both purine and pyrimidine
                    nucleotides for decades. Prior to RNA hydrolysis to NMP, yeast phosphatases must be inactivated or
                    separated from RNA. Palatability of yeast extracts can be further improved by enzymatic conversion
                    of AMP to IMP.

                    done toward its replacement by alternative products.
