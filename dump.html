                IMPDH II enzyme, highly active in lymphocytes, is a validated target to treat immunological diseases and
                to induce immunosuppression (CellCeptÂ®, a mycophenolic acid (MPA) prodrug - Roche. IMPDH is also
                recognized as an excellent target for the treatment of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and
                systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

                PNP deficiency leads to T-lymphocytopenia with no apparent effects on B-lymphocyte function. These
                symptoms suggest possible chemotherapeutic applications of potent inhibitors of PNP, as selective
                immunosuppressive agents, to treat T-cell leukemias or T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as
                lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis1.

                Antibiotic resistance is one of the world's most important public health problems. There is an urgent
                need for new antibiotic compounds acting on new targets. One attractive strategy for developing new
                antibiotics consists in in hibiting bacterial IMPDH, an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of
                purine nucleotides, necessary for bacterial cell growth and division.
