Principle
PRECICE® IMP, Inosine, and Hypoxanthine Assay Kit has been specifically designed in a 96-well plate format to facilitate the measurement of three major ATP catabolites in the same fish sample. The microplate is supplied prefilled with specific enzymes that irreversibly convert three nucleotides - IMP, inosine and hypoxanthine to one common substance - NADH2. After addition of boiled fish extract to microplate well and 30 min incubation, NADH is quantitatively measured at a wavelength of 340nm using microplate reader.  These absorbance data can be used to calculate K-value, H-value or other values:
