                Cellular Nucleotide Profiling Service is an analytical service for measuring nucleotide level in antimetabolite-treated cells. More than 31 cellular (deoxy-) ribonucleotides (mono-, di-, and triphosphate) are extracted by SPE procedure, separated by ion-paired HPLC system in one-run and quantified.

                Nucleotides participate in nearly all biochemical processes important for growth: ATP is an universal energy currency in all biological systems particularly abundant in muscles. Adenine nucleotides are components of three major coenzymes, NAD+, FAD, and CoA. Being building blocks of the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), nucleotides are particularly required for actively proliferating cells of the immune system or intestinal epithelium.
