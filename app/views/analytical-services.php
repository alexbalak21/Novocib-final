                    There are several analytical methods for separating and analyzing nucleotides:

                <ol>
                    <li>Anion Exchange Chromatography allows the separation and quantification of nucleotides mono-, di- and tr-phosphates. <br>
                        ðŸ˜’ However, this method does not allow the analysis of corresponding bases and nucleosides that can be present along with negatively charged nucleotides. </li>
                    <li>Acidic hydrolysis of nucleotides to corresponding bases followed by separation of heterocyclic bases. <br>
                        ðŸ˜’ However, this approach does not allow to discriminate whether heterocyclic bases result from the degradation of ribo- or deoxynucleotides or even from nucleic acids degradation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ion-paired chromatography is a technique that allows to separate both apolar (bases and nucleosides) and negatively charged compounds (nucleotides mono- di- and triphosphates) in one-run.<br>
                        ðŸ˜€ This technique overcomes challenges faced by other ion chromatography methods; <br>
                        ðŸ˜’ but requires careful selection of ion-pairing reagents and has limited column lifetime.

                    Using ion-paired high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection NOVOCIB provides HPLC analytical services of full spectra of nucleotides in cell extracts and in feed/ food products and ingredients.

                    Agilent 1120 series HPLC liquid chromatograph fitted with binary pump,
                    vacuum degasser, well-plate autosampler, thermostatic column
                    compartment and multiple wavelength and diode array detector. Run and
                    data acquisision are controlled by Agilent Chem Station software.
                    Zorbax Extend-C18 4.6x150mm, 3.5Î¼m particle size and guard column
                    (Agilent). Calibrations are performed with standards prepared in
                    mobile phase and with standards mixed with cell extracts, which are
                    run immediately before and after every series of samples. Peak
                    assignment of different bases, ribonucleosides and ribonucleoside
                    monophosphatesis is done by comparing both retention times and
                    characteristics of UV absorption spectra (254/280 ratio) with those of
                    standards. The area of individual peaks was measured using ChemStation
                    software (Agilent).
