<p><strong>Inosine Monophosphate Dehydrogenase (IMPDH)</strong> (EC 1.1.1.205) catalyzes the conversion of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine 5'- monophosphate (XMP), which is a crucial step for guanosine biosynthesis and for the pool of guanine nucleotides.</p>

<p>In Human, IMPDH is a validated target for several therapeutic applications (cancer, immunological disorders...). Several IMPDH inhibitors, including blockbusters (e.g. CellCeptÂ®), have shown their clinical efficacy. Besides nucleoside (or NAD) analogues, new chemical entities (NCEs) have been identified as efficient IMPDH inhibitors and are currently investigated.</p>
