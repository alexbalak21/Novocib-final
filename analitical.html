    <h6>Sources of dietary nucleotides :</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Since animal muscle is naturally rich in ATP, meat (pork, beef, chicken), fish and shrimps are excellent
            sources of purine nucleotides;
        </li>
        <li>
            Baker yeasts are naturally rich in RNA and yeast extracts are excellent sources of both purine and
            pyrimidine nucleotides.

    <h6>"Tasty" nucleotides:</h6>
    <p>
        5'-nucleotides IMP and GMP (also known as Inosinate and Guanylate) are strong flavour enhancers (E626-E633)
        involved in "umami" taste. Since yeasts are rich in ribonucleic acid (RNA), a natural source of 5' nucleotides
        (GMP, AMP, CMP and UMP), yeast extracts enriched in 5' nucleotides IMP and GMP are currently used as taste
        enhancers
